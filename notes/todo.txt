Concept
The main page shows a list of my projects, include an "about me" /resume item on this list.

Each project has an about project page. This will be effectively a description, preview, 
how it was made, showcase images/video, and a link to the github, download, and/or functioning site.

The about me page will effectively include my resume, linkedin, and contact info.
